```

## R Markdown

Load library
```{r ci1}
library(CI)
library(MASS)
```

Generate data for analysis
```{r ci2}
cr = 0.95
df <- mvrnorm(50, mu = c(0,0), Sigma = matrix(c(1,cr,cr,1), ncol = 2), empirical = TRUE)
```

Calculate concordance index
```{r ci3}
CI(x=df[,1], y=df[,2], deltaX=0, deltaY=0, alpha =0, outx = 1, npermut=10000)
```




Calculate correlations
```{r ci4}
cor.test(df[,1], df[,2])
cor.test(df[,1], df[,2], method = "pearson")
cor.test(df[,1], df[,2], method = "spearman")
```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
